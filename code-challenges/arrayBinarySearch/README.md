# Challenge Summary
Binary Search of 1d array is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm#Procedure).

## Challenge Description
This searches for the index of a key in a sorted list. It will return a -1 if the key is not found.

## Approach & Efficiency
Performance: O(log(n))
Storage: O(1)
