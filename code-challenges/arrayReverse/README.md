# Reverse an Array
I created a function that reverses an array in-place using a for loop and temporary variables.

## Challenge
The challenge was figuring how to make it global and understanding efficiency.

## Approach & Efficiency
I decided to take this approach because I was not able to use any built-in javascript methods to solve the problem.
Big O space O(1)
Big O time: O(n)

## Solution
