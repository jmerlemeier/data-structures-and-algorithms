# Merge 2 Linked Lists 
Zip together 2 linked lists.

## Challenge
Use a function that takes in 2 list as arguments. Sip them together so that the node alternate. Then return the zipped list. Try to keep the space to O(1).
Access to: Node class and the linkedList class and methods.

## Approach & Efficiency
I created 2 temporary variables to help reference nodes a I re-assigned the order of the linked lists to they refererenced each other in the order I wanted.
Time: 0(n)
Space: 0(1)
